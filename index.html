<p>

	Asansol Institute of Engineering and Management-Polytechnic, Located near Kalipahari More has been founded by education lovers to fill a gap in private diploma level engineering colleges in and around the West Bengal-Jharkhand belt, with an aim to make good quality education accessible to students by means of a student-oriented institute, which has been demonstrated from our very first intake in June 2015.
	
	Our highly experienced faculties, aided by state of the art facilities in laboratories and classrooms are dedicated towards helping pupils achieve their true potential, and AIEM-P has already gained a reputation for being academically sound. Students are motivated to strengthen their strengths and work on their weaknesses together with the academic staff With a great classroom experience, individual attention, along with the use of digital tools and notes, our students do not feel the need for private tuitions.

	It is our firm belief that along with being academically strong, students need to be complete individuals and therefore, there is a healthy focus on sports and extra-curricular activities in the institute. Our cultural and social clubs have organised events such as Biswakarma Puja, Saraswati Puja, Independence Day, Republic Day, Sadbhavna Diwas, Foundation Day etc. with aplomb and our sports' grounds host basketball, volleyball and badminton matches. Our learners have already exhibited necessary intra and inter-personal qualities inside and outside their classrooms.
	
	As one of the fastest growing economies in the world, India is going through an industrial expansion that requires skilled technicians in large numbers. Although a significant number of people are graduating as diploma engineers every year, there remains a lack in efficient, truly knowledgeable and skilled diploma engineers in the country, and at AIEM-P it is our modest attempt to fill this gap a little. Our devotion to our purpose grows every day and with the discipline and commitment that our students exhibit, we are confident that our Institute will produce citizens to make our nation proud.
